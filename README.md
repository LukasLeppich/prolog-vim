# VIM-Plugin for prolog

This plugin is the result of a master internship at the University of WÃ¼rzburg.
It uses the [Language Server Protocol v2.x](https://github.com/Microsoft/language-server-protocol/blob/master/versions/protocol-2-x.md) to provide a simple autocompletion for prolog in vim.

The plugin is splitted into three parts:

* The VIM plugin in `autoload`, `ftdetect` and `ftplugin`. It handles the filetype, starts the python scripts and sets the `omnifunc` for autocompletion. 
* The python part of the plugin in `script`. It is used start the language server and handles the communication.
* The prolog language server in `script/server`. The server is used to analyze the prolog source files and provide a simple autocomplete functionality.



## Instalation

```
set runtimepath+=~/.vim/bundle/prolog-vim

You can also use a plugin manager like [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) to install the plugin.
